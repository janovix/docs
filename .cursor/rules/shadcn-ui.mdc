## UI rule (this project)

When implementing or modifying UI in this repository:

- **Use shadcn/ui by default**: Prefer composing UI from shadcn/ui components (copied into the repo, typically under `src/components/ui/*`) instead of hand-rolling raw HTML + Tailwind for common primitives (buttons, inputs, dialogs, dropdowns, etc.).
- **Use available registries**: Prefer pulling components/patterns from the registries configured in `components.json` (via the shadcn registry tooling / MCP server) before building bespoke UI.
- **Registry intent (what to reach for)**: When you need something beyond the core primitives, prefer these registries (in roughly this order, depending on the need):
  - **`@shadcnui-blocks`**: A collection of premium, production-ready shadcn/ui blocks, components and templates.
  - **`@react-bits`**: A large collection of animated, interactive & fully customizable React components for building memorable websites.
  - **`@svgl`**: A beautiful library with SVG logos (mostly brand logos like Apple, Google, GitHub, etc.).
  - **`@ai-elements`**: Pre-built components like conversations, messages and more to help you build AI-native applications faster.
  - **`@hooks`**: A comprehensive React Hooks Collection built with Shadcn.
- **Only deviate intentionally**: If a shadcn component is not suitable (performance, accessibility, design constraint, bundle size, etc.) or the user explicitly requests no shadcn, explain why and then proceed with a custom implementation.
